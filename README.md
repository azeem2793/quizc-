Imagine you're assigned as a developer to this project and you have to make the first step in the refactoring of Parser.cs There are many issues in these classes, even though they compile and work.

Try to spend 10-15 minutes maximum for the entire work. If you need more time, you're doing something wrong. Remember, you have to do just the first step in refactoring. Don't fix everything.

Thanks!
